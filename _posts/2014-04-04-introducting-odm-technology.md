title: Introducing ODM Technology
---

[Open Democracy Manitoba](http://opendemocracymanitoba.ca) (ODM) is a community organization that builds online election resources with the goal of fostering government accountability, transparency and public education. I helped found ODM back in the summer of 2010 while we were building the [WinnipegElection.ca](http://winnipegelection.ca) website. The following year we built [ManitobaElection.ca](http://manitobaelection.ca). These sites have helped over 75,000 unique voters research their candidates and learn about their local democratic process.

The goal of this blog is to document the technolgies we are using as well as the process of developing and maintaining our websites. This fall there will be another civic election in Winnipeg. As such I have began redesigning the [WinnipegElection.ca](http://winnipegelection.ca) (WE) website from the ground up. The original WE site was built using [Rails](http://rubyonrails.org) 2.3 and was hosted on an [Ubuntu](http://ubuntu.com) 8.04 server using [Apache](http://www.apache.org), [Phusion Passenger](https://www.phusionpassenger.com), and [MySQL](http://www.mysql.com). The upcoming version will be powered by Rails 4.1, Ubuntu 12.04, [Nginx](http://nginx.org), Phusion Passenger and [PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org).

This blog was built using [Poole](http://getpoole.com/) and [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) following [Joshua Lande's tutorial](http://joshualande.com/jekyll-github-pages-poole/). It is hosted on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
