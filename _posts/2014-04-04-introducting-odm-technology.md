title: Introducing Process & Technology
---

[Open Democracy Manitoba](http://opendemocracymanitoba.ca) (ODM) is a community organization that builds online election resources with the goal of fostering government accountability, transparency and public education. I helped found ODM back in the summer of 2010 while we were building the [WinnipegElection.ca](http://winnipegelection.ca) website. The following year we built [ManitobaElection.ca](http://manitobaelection.ca). These sites have helped over 75,000 voters research their candidates and learn about their local democratic process.

The name of this blog is Process and Technology. It's goal is to document the technologies and processes used to build and maintain our websites. This fall there will be a civic election in Winnipeg. As such, we have started rebuilding the [WinnipegElection.ca](http://winnipegelection.ca) (WE) website from the ground up. The original WE site was built using [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org) on [Rails](http://rubyonrails.org) 2.3 and was hosted on an [Ubuntu](http://ubuntu.com) 8.04 server using [Apache](http://www.apache.org), [Phusion Passenger](https://www.phusionpassenger.com), and [MySQL](http://www.mysql.com). The upcoming version will be powered by Rails 4.1, Ubuntu 12.04, [Nginx](http://nginx.org), Phusion Passenger and [PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org).

We've got lots of new features planned for the new WE site. I am especially excited to implement election-versioning to allow us to archive electoral races.

**P.S.** This blog was built using [Poole](http://getpoole.com/) and [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) following [Joshua Lande's tutorial](http://joshualande.com/jekyll-github-pages-poole/). Blog entries are written in [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/). The blog is hosted on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
