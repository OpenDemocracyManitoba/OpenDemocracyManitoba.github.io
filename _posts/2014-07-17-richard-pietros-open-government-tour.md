[Register up to attend!](https://www.eventbrite.ca/e/the-open-government-tour-winnipeg-tickets-12153636855?aff=efbevent)

This summer [Richard](https://twitter.com/richardpietro) is driving his motorcycle across the country promoting democratic engagement by way of technology, transparency and accountability. The intent of his tour (as described in [this article](http://o.canada.com/technology/internet/its-time-to-make-civic-engagement-sexy-again)) is to "introduce Open Gov/Data to Canadians, hopefully acting as a spark that will help push the movements over the tipping point and change the perspective that this kind of stuff isn’t only relegated to the uber-civically engaged, politico, or super-techie." More details at [opengovtour.org](http://opengovtour.org).

Open Democracy Manitoba is hosting the event along with sponsors the [Community News Commons](ihttp://www.communitynewscommons.org/) and the [Winnipeg Public Library](http://wpl.winnipeg.ca/library/).

We've already confirmed two guests for the evening:

**Mary Agnes Welch** of the Winnipeg Free Press. Mary Agnes has written a number of data-driven stories for the Winnipeg Free Press. She also works with journalism students at Red River College on FIPPA / Data research projects.

**Colin Craig** of the Canadian Tax Payers Federation. Colin's interest in open government is due to his experience with FIPPA requests and his organization's focus on accountability.

We're currently in talks with the following folks to secure more participants:

* Representative from the [City of Winnipeg's new open data portal](http://data.winnipeg.ca) team.
* Representative from [Winnipeg Transit's open API](http://api.winnipegtransit.com/home/api) team.
* Representative from the community health portal [myPeg.ca](mypeg.ca) created by the United Way / International Institute of Sustainable Development

The event will follow a "late night talk-show" format. The evening will be broken down into two groups of guests, with a theme topic for each group. The Toronto event was organized into three sections:

* Intro; relationship with Make Web Not War; What is Open Source?
* The culture of Open Government. What does it look like? What are the obstacles? Where are the low hanging fruits?
* Open Data / Technology conversation. What are the tools and processes that can help make Open Government a reality?

[The Winnipeg event](https://www.eventbrite.ca/e/the-open-government-tour-winnipeg-tickets-12153636855?aff=efbevent) is confirmed and we've booked the Carol Shield's auditorium at the Millennium Library (Downtown Graham at Donald) from 6 until 9:30pm on August 11th.

[Richard reports back](http://us8.campaign-archive1.com/home/?u=b94b0db339ea741f039bcb481&id=c8e6419b9b) that the first four events on the tour in Toronto, Kingston, Montreal and Halifax were very successful.

### What I Need From You

Start following and retweeting the [#OGT14 hashtag](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23ogt14), share [the Event Brite Event](https://www.eventbrite.ca/e/the-open-government-tour-winnipeg-tickets-12153636855?aff=efbbt) and [the Facebook Event](https://www.facebook.com/events/1448796188709824/).

The event will be dedicated to introducing Open Gov/Data to people who are new to the space. If you’re well-informed in this area, please reach out to your family/friends and bring someone less open-savvy along.

Do you have anyone you can suggest as a local guest? We're looking for open-data, open-source, or open-gov practitioners. Feel free to think beyond the tech world. How about a local educator, artist or activist working in this space? We are hoping to have all guests confirmed by July 22nd, next Tuesday.

I could also use some suggestions for pulling in a more diverse audience.

### This is What Open Source Looks Like

To model the open source process, ODM co-founder [Ken Harasym](https://twitter.com/kenharasym) created an Open Source Poster for the 2014 Open Government Tour. A poster kit including editable DOC and PDF versions can be [downloaded here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B1dJTagt8-2NOW5YZTBTbGJNTjQ/edit?usp=sharing), there is also [an editable version on Canva](https://www.canva.com/design/DAA0vHvdxz0/9wkvi7mrfkXqlMcEukX-RA/edit).

OGT14 City champions across Canada can now customize is poster for their local event, print and promote.
