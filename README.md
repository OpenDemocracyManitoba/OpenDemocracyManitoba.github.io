## Poole and Jekyll

This site was built using [Poole](http://getpoole.com/) and [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com).

[Poole](http://getpoole.com/) is the butler for [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), the static site generator. It's designed and developed by [@mdo](https://twitter.com/mdo) to provide a clear and concise foundational setup for any Jekyll site. It does so by furnishing a full vanilla Jekyll install with example templates, pages, posts, and styles.
