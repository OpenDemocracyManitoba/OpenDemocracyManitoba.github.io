This is how I met Richard Pietro and learned of his plan to drive his motorcycle across the country promoting democratic engagement by way of technology, transparency and accountability. The intent of his tour was to introduce Open Government to Canadians. And so this past summer, in cities across Canada, Richard modeled civic engagement as an art form, curating open government discussions with public servants, programmers, journalists, entrepreneurs, and citizens.

On August 11th 2014 Richard Pietro’s Open Government Tour attracted a crowd of engaged citizens to the Millennium Library in downtown Winnipeg. The crowd was eager to hear Richard and guests introduce the Open Government movement with home grown examples.

The event was co-moderated by Richard and myself (Kyle Geske of Open Democracy Manitoba). The Winnipeg guests were Mary Agnes Welch of the Winnipeg Free Press, Colin Craig of the Canadian Taxpayers Federation, Kirk Cumming, manager of data & application service for the City of Winnipeg, Charles Thrift of the International Institute for Sustainable Development (IISD), and Dennis Lewycky of the Social Planning Council of Winnipeg.

We were happy with the turnout, which included a number of city journalists and candidates for the 2013 Winnipeg election, including three mayoral candidates: Brian Bowman, Robert-Falcon Oullette and Judy Wasylycia-Leis.

The evening started with Richard explaining what Open Government and Open Data are and why they are important, with the help of a few memes.

## First panel: Access and why it's important

Paper is to #OpenData as KFC is to Canada Food Guide

uses FIPPA to push for policy changes — i.e. where to find savings — and to investigate citizens' tips.

Like journalism, technology is not objective, Lewycky says. Can be used in biased way. Or: different metrics can create bias.

Magnes notes that the data is the START of a story, not the story itself. Data gives opportunity for stories that might be missed

Educating the public about open data.

"There's not just some kind of accountability that comes with democracy. We're the accountants!"

City's own data needs to be unlocked, shared, made usable for all public servants, says Cummings.
