It began with this tweet. On replying I learnt of Richard's plan to tour Canada promoting democratic engagement. This past summer, in cities across Canada, Richard modeled civic engagement as an art form, curating discussions about **Open Government** with public servants, programmers, journalists, entrepreneurs, and citizens.

> Open government is the governing doctrine which holds that citizens have the right to access the documents and proceedings of the government to allow for effective public oversight. source: [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_government)

On August 11th 2014 **Richard Pietro’s Open Government Tour** (OGT14) attracted a crowd to the Millennium Library in downtown Winnipeg. The event was sponsored by [Open Democracy Manitoba](http://opendemocracymanitoba.ca), and hosted by [Community News Commons](http://www.communitynewscommons.org/) and the [Winnipeg Public Library](http://wpl.winnipeg.ca/library/).

Although we'd spoken during the video chat planning sessions with other OGT14 "City Champions", I first met Ricard in person the day of the event. Fellow ODM member [Ken Harasym](https://twitter.com/kenharasym) and I met him in the morning at a motorbike shop on Pembina, followed by breakfast at the Pancake house. Despite [the bike problems he was dealing with](http://www.webnotwar.ca/ogt14-week-7-update/) Richard was in good spirits. With his bike out of commission, I voluteered to chauffeur him around for the day. This meant I was able to join him discussing Open Government and Open Data with [Dahlia Kurtz](https://twitter.com/DahliaKurtz) on her [CJOB](http://www.cjob.com) radio show. We also got to spend the day chatting and getting to know each other.

The Winnipeg OGT14 event was co-moderated by Richard and myself ([Kyle Geske](http://twitter.com/stungeye) of Open Democracy Manitoba). The evening started with Richard defining Open Government and Open Data and why they are important, with the help of a few memes.

The crowd was eager to hear Richard and guests introduce the Open Government movement while discussing local Open Gov / Open Data ideas and initiatives. A number of city journalists and three mayoral candidates for the 2014 Winnipeg Election, Brian Bowman, Robert-Falcon Oullette and Judy Wasylycia-Leis, were in attendance along with 70+ engaged citizens.

## First Half: Access and why it's important

The first panel of guests included [Mary Agnes Welch](https://twitter.com/mawwelch) of the Winnipeg Free Press, [Colin Craig](https://twitter.com/colincraig1) of the Canadian Taxpayers Federation, and [Dennis Lewycky](http://dennislewycky.ca/about/) of the Social Planning Council of Winnipeg. We were also joined by [Keith McDonald](https://twitter.com/cotkeith) from the City of Toronto's Open Data team via Skype.

#### Some Highlights

* **Richard:** Open Data is about restoring trust in our government.
* **Colin:** Open Data and [FIPPA Requests](http://www.gov.mb.ca/chc/fippa/index.html) can be used by citizens or organizations to push government for policy changes. 
* **Keith:** "Paper is to Open Data as KFC is to the Canadian Food Guide."
* **Mary Agnes:** Data in journalism as *starting place* for stories that might otherwise have been missed.
* **Dennis:** A reminder that technology is not objective. Different metrics used to quantify and explain data can create bias.

When asked by audience member [Dan Bernardic](https://twitter.com/bernardic) about what all this means for the average citizen, I tried to express what I see as the importance of Open Government. That government accountability isn't something that comes pre-packaged with a democracy. We the citizens are the accountants but an account needs their spreadsheets. ;)

## Second Half: Meeting the Makers

The second panel of guests included [Kirk Cumming](https://www.linkedin.com/pub/kirk-cumming/13/691/71), manager of data & application service for the City of Winnipeg, [Charles Thrift](https://www.linkedin.com/pub/charles-thrift/15/18b/384) of the International Institute for Sustainable Development (IISD). [Jose Javier](http://twitter.com/jiguiniz), Senior Policy Analyst at Ontario Ministry of Government Services, and [Andrew Fogg](http://twitter.com/andrewfogg) of [import.io](import.io) joined us by way of Skype.

#### Some Highlights

Open Government Licence establishes rules for gov't and citizens. Encourages people to use #opendata.

PEG is providing #opendata as an NGO. Trying to answer questions like, is Winnipeg's poverty rate going up or down?

Kirk Cumming is at #OGT14 to discuss "the beginning of @cityofwinnipeg open data journey." Manager of data & application services

City's own data needs to be unlocked, shared, made usable for all public servants, says Cummings.

Three classes of #opendata users: API users, data analysts (researchers/reporters), general public (want to answer Qs): Cummings

## Richard's Summary

> Kyle Geske, Ken Harasym, Jody Gillis, Andrew Burton, Tessa Vanderhart, and Noah Erenberg were the folks that brought the #OGT14 Winnipeg event together and man, they couldn’t have been more awesome, and for so many different reason.
 
> First, we had the perfect venue, awesome invited guests, lots of food, a dedicated person live tweeting the event, PLUS two cameramen capturing the event. The event ran like clockwork and afterwards the organizers told me their group had never organized an event before! If that’s the case, I can’t wait to see how good their events become once they become seasoned veterans lol.

## Part Two - The Return of the #OGT14

On September 6th we held a smaller, more informal, Open Government Tour event when Richard stopped in Winnipeg on the return leg of the tour. This event was held at Cousin's Deli.
