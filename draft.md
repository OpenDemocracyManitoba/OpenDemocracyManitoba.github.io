We're currently in talks with the following folks to secure more participants:

* Representative from the City of Winnipeg's new open data portal team.
* Representative from Winnipeg Transit's open API team.
* Representative from the community health portal myPeg.ca created by the United Way / International Institute of Sustainable Development

The event will follow a "late night talk-show" format. The evening will be broken down into two groups of guests, with a theme topic for each group. The Toronto event was organized into three sections:

* Intro; relationship with Make Web Not War; What is Open Source?
* The culture of Open Government. What does it look like? What are the obstacles? Where are the low hanging fruits?
* Open Data / Technology conversation. What are the tools and processes that can help make Open Government a reality?

The Winnipeg event is confirmed and we've booked the Carol Shield's auditorium at the Millennium Library from 6 until 9:30pm on August 11th. Richard reports back that the first three events on the tour in Toronto, Kingston and Montreal were very successful.
