title: Richard Pietro's Open Government Tour Retrospective
---

It began with this tweet. This is how I met Richard Pietro.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>Hello <a href="https://twitter.com/stungeye">@stungeye</a>! I read that you&#39;re part of Open Democracy Manitoba and thought you might be interested about a project I&#39;m working on :-)</p>&mdash; Richard Pietro (@richardpietro) <a href="https://twitter.com/richardpietro/status/456969530200580096">April 18, 2014</a></blockquote>

After replying I would learn of Richard's plan to drive his motorcycle across the country promoting democratic engagement by way of technology, transparency and accountability. The intent of his tour was to introduce Open Government to Canadians. And so this past summer, in cities across Canada, Richard modeled civic engagement as an art form, curating open government discussions with public servants, programmers, journalists, entrepreneurs, and citizens.

On August 11th 2014 Richard Pietro’s Open Government Tour attracted a crowd of engaged citizens to the Millennium Library in downtown Winnipeg. The event was sponsored by [Open Democracy Manitoba](http://opendemocracymanitoba.ca), and hosted by [Community News Commons](http://www.communitynewscommons.org/) and the [Winnipeg Public Library](http://wpl.winnipeg.ca/library/). The crowd was eager to hear Richard and guests introduce the Open Government movement with home grown examples.

The event was co-moderated by Richard and myself ([Kyle Geske](http://twitter.com/stungeye) of Open Democracy Manitoba). We were happy with the turnout of nearly seventy five people, which included a number of city journalists and three mayoral candidates for the 2014 Winnipeg Election: Brian Bowman, Robert-Falcon Oullette and Judy Wasylycia-Leis.

The evening started with Richard defining Open Government and Open Data and why they are important, with the help of a few memes.

## First panel: Access and why it's important

The first panel of guests included Mary Agnes Welch of the Winnipeg Free Press, Colin Craig of the Canadian Taxpayers Federation, and Dennis Lewycky of the Social Planning Council of Winnipeg. We were also joined by Keith McDonald from the City of Toronto's Open Data team via Twitter.

Paper is to #OpenData as KFC is to Canada Food Guide

uses FIPPA to push for policy changes — i.e. where to find savings — and to investigate citizens' tips.

Like journalism, technology is not objective, Lewycky says. Can be used in biased way. Or: different metrics can create bias.

Magnes notes that the data is the START of a story, not the story itself. Data gives opportunity for stories that might be missed

Educating the public about open data.

"There's not just some kind of accountability that comes with democracy. We're the accountants!"

## Second Half Meeting the Makers

The second panel of guests included Kirk Cumming, manager of data & application service for the City of Winnipeg, Charles Thrift of the International Institute for Sustainable Development (IISD). [Jose Javier](http://twitter.com/jiguiniz), Senior Policy Analyst at Ontario Ministry of Government Services, and [Andrew Fogg](http://twitter.com/andrewfogg) of [import.io](import.io) joined us by way of Skype.

City's own data needs to be unlocked, shared, made usable for all public servants, says Cummings.

## Part Two - The Return of the #OGT14

On September 6th we held a smaller, more informal, Open Government Tour event when Richard stopped in Winnipeg on the return leg of the tour. This event was held at Cousin's Deli.
