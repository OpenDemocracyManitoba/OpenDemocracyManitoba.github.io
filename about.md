This is the development blog for the coding projects created by [Open Democracy Manitoba](http://opendemocracymanitoba.ca) written by [Kyle Geske](http://twitter.com/stungeye), one of the co-founders of ODM.

[Open Democracy Manitoba](http://opendemocracymanitoba.ca) (ODM) is a community organization that builds online election resources with the goal of fostering government accountability, transparency and public education. Our websites are volunteer-run and are operated in the spirit of openness, community and accountability.

We believe that Canada's voter engagement can be greatly increased. To this end we developed [WinnipegElection.ca](http://winnipegelection.ca) and [ManitobaElection.ca](http://manitobaelection.ca) as resources for our local civic and provincial elections. During our 2010 and 2011 civic and provincial elections these sites helped over 75,000 unique voters research their candidates and learn about their local democratic process.

This blog was built using [Poole](http://getpoole.com/) and [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com).
